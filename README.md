# üöÄ Getting started

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.
## ü•¶ Requirements
To start working with the Strapi CM template you have to 
- Node V18
- NPM
- MySQL
- Docker
## üí® Running Strapi locally
You can use this strapi template locally  in two different ways for development: 

- running locally with the `develop`, `start` or `build` commands list below
- Using `docker-compose` to create 
### 1. Create `.env` file 
Create a `.env` file taking into consideration the `.env.example` structure.
In the terminal you can run the following command to avoid misspelling and data  lost:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, fill all the required variables before starting the server.
[Learn more about .env files](https://medium.com/@sujathamudadla1213/what-is-the-use-of-env-8d6b3eb94843)

### 2. Run strapi 
#### BEST ONE -> Docker
When using Docker, you only need to set the required variables in `.env` file and then, run the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up 
```
Once you do this, two containers are gonna be created: 
1. cms-strapi-development
2. mysql-strapi-development


üöß Important: for the following options you need to create you own DB and set the different variables to connect to it (check the `.env` file). A MySQL DB is required.
