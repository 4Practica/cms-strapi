# üöÄ Getting started

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## ü•¶ Requirements

To start working with the Strapi CM template you have to

- Node V18
- NPM
- MySQL
- Docker

## üí® Running Strapi locally

You can use this strapi template locally in two different ways for development:

- running locally with the `develop`, `start` or `build` commands list below
- Using `docker-compose` to create

### 1. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file taking into consideration the `.env.example` structure.
In the terminal you can run the following command to avoid misspelling and data lost:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill all the required variables before starting the server.
[Learn more about .env files](https://medium.com/@sujathamudadla1213/what-is-the-use-of-env-8d6b3eb94843)

### 2. Run strapi

#### BEST ONE -> Docker

When using Docker, you only need to set the required variables in `.env` file and then, run the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Once you do this, two containers are gonna be created:

1. cms-strapi-development
2. mysql-strapi-development

## üöß Important: for the following options you need to create you own DB and set the different variables to connect to it (check the `.env` file). A MySQL DB is required.

#### Good for development: `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-develop)

```
npm run develop
```

#### Good for production : `start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-start)

```
npm run start
```

#### Admin panel: `build`

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-build)

```
npm run build
```

### üöÄ Release a new version into production Docker hub

This guide outlines the required steps to build and publish a new version of a Docker image to Docker Hub.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Every release must include:
> - A version tag (e.g., `1.0.1`)
> - The `latest` tag pointing to that version

> Note 
> - The `<version>` should be replace
> - The `<repo-name>` should be replace with `cms-strapi`

---

### üß± Step 1: Build the image with a version tag

Replace `<version>` with the version you are releasing:

```shell
docker build -f docker-compose.prod.yml --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 -t bryanstgarcia/<repo-name>:<version> 
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Step 2: Tag the image as latest

This ensures that the latest tag always reflects the most recent version.
```shell
docker tag bryanstgarcia/<repo-name>:<version> bryanstgarcia/<repo-name>:latest
```
You can also use the image id to tag. Sometimes is easier.

### üîê Step 3: Log in to Docker Hub (if not already logged in)
```shell
docker login
```
Enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 4: Push both tags to Docker Hub
```shell
docker push bryanstgarcia/<repo-name>:<version>
docker push bryanstgarcia/<repo-name>:latest
```
Both tags must be pushed for the release to be considered complete.

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify the release on Docker Hub
Go to: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bryanstgarcia/reverse-proxy

Make sure both tags are listed:

`<version>` and `latest`
